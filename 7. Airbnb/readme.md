## 7. Project: *"Why More Homeowners Should Join Airbnb and List Their Homes for Longterm Stays"* (Analysis of Airbnb Long-Term Listings in the US)" for Data Science for All/Empowerment by Correlation One (October 2021 - March 2022)

**Purpose**:  Demonstrate understanding of data science using exploratory data analysis to investigate the specific questions for the business problem proposed for your capstone project.

**Description**:  During the pandemic, Airbnb faced the loss of a significant number of its hosts and listings.  In this project, we performed an analysis of the top 3 most popular cities for long-term listing (Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle) using Python, Tableau, and Google Colabatory to highlight the trends and benefits of long-term listings in hopes of incentivizing homeowners to become hosts and list their properties on Airbnbâ€™s platform.

**My Role**:  Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Graphic designer, Presentation Designer.

I worked remotely with a team of 2 other remote Fellows. We met each week for no less than 1 hour to  ensure we were on track with our deliverables. We acquired our large datasets on Airbnb from Kaggle and used the Airbnb website to acquire further public company information. We divided the work to clean and prepare the data for analysis through Python. We utilized Tableau to create visualization and I used Google Analytics to prepare our final datafolio for presentation.
