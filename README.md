# studentprojects
These final projects are a few examples of the individual and group work that I completed while studying business administration and computer information systems at Baruch College during 2020-2021.
They reflect my interests, creativity, business analysis, and ability to collaborate to publically present before an audience.

My role:  Analyst, Designer, and Developer. I wrote the concept and analysis including the website goals, intended users, website visit scenarios, competitor analysis and the web project design. I planned and designed a logo and a product landing page using Canva, layouts and frameworks, then applied web design principles and coding strategies to create a mobile-responsive website with hyperlinks, tables, images, and forms using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. For this site, extra emphasis was focused on the color specifications, graphics, and typography.

Description:  With a team of 4 other students, we focused on creating data visualizations on various subtopics within the Olympic Games such as history, country participation, specific athlete records, record comparisons, and most popular sports. We sourced most of our information from datasets found on kaggle.com
My role:  Co-leader and contributor. I suggested the general topic idea and led in group discussions, scheduling meetings, and overall direction of the presentation. For my visualizations, I cleaned data in Excel files then used Tableau to display trends using various line graphs, maps, bar charts, and tables.

The problem identification should provide a recommendation that the company could pursue to address this problem, along with actions towards its implementation
My role:  Business Analyst, Copywriter, Editor. I analyzed the market share, marketing strategies, business acquisitions for the company analytical reports. Throughout the entire term project, I edited the documents for grammatical accuracy and fluency.

My role:  I suggested the topic and served as a co-leader of the group. I web scraped data from an Excel file with 3,000 rows, used NumPy to create ndarrays, index, and sort data, then used Pandas to create Series, DataFrames, and aggregate data with GroupBy and pivot tables. Finally, I used Matplotlib to create graphs and highlight important data.
