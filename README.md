# Projects
Projects #1 - #6 are term projects I completed for different classes over 3 semesters while studying business administration and computer information systems at Baruch College from 2020 - 2021. They consist of individual effort and collective teamwork.

Project #7: The Airbnb project was conducted during my post-graduate fellowship program with Data Science for All/Empowerment from October 2021 - March 2022.

All projects were completed remotely and resulted in a virtual presentation to an audience of peers.

The projects reflect my curiosity, interests, creativity, and skills in research, business analysis, collaboration, and presentation.

Below I describe the purpose of each, a description, and my role in each project.


# 1. Project: “Rose & Renewed: The Book, The Brand, The Artist” Website for course CIS 3630:  Principles of Web Design
Purpose:  Demonstrate the fundamentals of web design and development by building a functional site.

Description: “Rose & Renewed: The Book” is a concept website and blog promoting a fictional author, book, and blog. The goal of the website is to promote a visual aesthetic, increase audience engagement through a photo gallery and blog, and sell a book.

My role:  Business Analyst, User Experience, Presentation Designer, Graphic Designer, Web Developer. 
I wrote the concept and analysis (the website goals, intended users, website visit scenarios, competitor analysis and the web project design).
I designed a logo on Canva and sourced images from my personal files in addition to Canva. I placed specific emphasis on the colors used, graphics, and typography to match the aesthetic theme of the project. Using web design principles, coding strategies, layouts and frameworks, I developed the product landing page and mobile-responsive website with hyperlinks, menu, grid, tables, images, and forms using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery.  

# 2.  Project: "UNICIRCLE" for course CIS 5800:  Information Technology and Project Management
Purpose:  Build an understanding of the principles and applications of project management, the software development life cycle, and work as a team to deliver a working prototype of software.

Description:  A team of 4 other students and myself created UniCircle, a concept web application to help college students form study groups and professional connections within their own college. 

My role:  Co-Project Manager, Business Analyst, Presentation Designer, Graphic Designer, Audio editor. My responsibilities as the Co-Project Manager and Business Analyst were to: manage members, set expectations for the work schedule and performance standards, motivate the team, contribute to the deliverables and document our activities in meeting logs with detailed notes; analyze the existing business opportunity, develop the rollout plan, compute the budget and project costs, estimate time schedules, and develop the marketing strategy and risk/contingency plans.

# 3.  Project: "Storytelling with Data - The Olympic Games" for course CIS 4170:  Data Visualization                       
Purpose:  Transform data into visual representations so that decision makers can effectively use interactive visualization for analytical reasoning. Find a dataset and build visuals to tell a story using Tableau. 

Description:  With a team of 4 other students, we focused on creating data visualizations on various subtopics within the Olympic Games. For my subtopics, I focused on country participation, prize money per medal, mens and womens record times, Allyson Felix highlights, and most popular sports in the Winter Olympics. We sourced most of our information from datasets found on kaggle.com and created individual excel files to clean and prepare the data.

My role:  Co-Project Manager, Data Scientist, Presentation Designer. I recommended the general topic idea and led in group discussions, scheduling meetings, and overall direction of the presentation. To create visualizations, I cleaned data in Excel files then used Tableau to display trends using various line graphs, maps, bar charts, and tables.

# 4.  Project: "Anthem" for course BPL 5100:  Business Policy
Purpose: Identify and diagnose issues related to interactions among multiple areas of organizations for the company; apply strategic management techniques to generate recommendations for strategic issues; synthesize arguments and recommendations in persuasive oral and written communications.

Description:  With a team of 4 other students, for the final term project, our goal was to play the role of external consultants to the company and highlight any current or future problems that the company could face, then provide a recommendation the company could pursue to address this problem, along with actions towards its implementation.

My role: Researcher, Project Manager, Business Analyst, Presentation Designer, Copywriter, Editor. My responsibilities as the Project Manager and Business Analyst were to: maintain the project plan and track progress, document our activities, act as a liaison between the professor and students, and close communication gaps with my team of international students. Throughout the entire term project, I edited the copywriting for company analytical reports for grammatical accuracy and fluency.

# 5. Project: "Evaluating the NYC Housing Market using 2010-2020 Census Data" for course CIS 3120:  Programming for Analytics            
Purpose:  Demonstrate proficiency using Python to complete a term project.

Description:  With a team of 2 other students, we analyzed the variances in population within the 5 boroughs of New York City using data from the census bureau to analyze whether COVID-19 significantly impacted the population size of New York City over the span of a decade.

My role:  I suggested the topic and served as a co-project manager of the group. I web scraped data from an Excel file with 3,000+ rows and used Python to clean and prepare the data. With NumPy, I created ndarrays, indexed, and sorted data. Used Pandas to create Series, DataFrames, and aggregated data with GroupBy and pivot tables. I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various visuals for data analysis and to test our hypothesis. 

# 6. Project: "Hopper: A Look at Usability, Privacy and Security" for CIS 3770: Uability, Privacy, and Security

Description: Hopper is a travel application available on iOS and Android for free that provides data on the cheapest flights, hotels, cars, homes. You can make reservations through the app. This was a solo term project where I had to conduct a thorough evaluation of a privacy or security aspect of an existing mobile application and present my findings in audiovisual format. I chose Hopper because it was a newer app and I have used it for travel.

My role: Analyst, Researcher, User Experience Tester, Presentation Designer. Through the project, I collected data and applied the concepts, methods, and techniques learned in the course to my project. I evaluated the app for functionality, user authentication, heuristics, security, and the privacy policy. I recruited a user from my target population of the app and provided a script to conduct an individual usability test through the "think aloud" method. I analyzed their verbalizations and created a summary of my findings.


# 7. Project: "Why More Homeowners Should Join Airbnb and List Their Homes for Longterm Stays" (Analysis of Airbnb Long-Term Listings in the US)" for Data Science for All/Empowerment by Correlation One (October 2021 - March 2022)
Purpose:  Demonstrate understanding of data science using exploratory data analysis to investigate the specific questions for the business problem proposed for your capstone project.

Description:  During the pandemic, Airbnb faced the loss of a significant number of its hosts and listings.  In this project, we performed an analysis of the top 3 most popular cities for long-term listing (Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle) using Python, Tableau, and Google Colabatory to highlight the trends and benefits of long-term listings in hopes of incentivizing homeowners to become hosts and list their properties on Airbnb’s platform.

My Role:  Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Graphic designer, Presentation Designer. I worked online with a team of 2 other remote Fellows. We met each week for no less than 1 hour to  ensure we were on track with our deliverables. We acquired our large datasets on Airbnb from Kaggle and used the Airbnb website to acquire further public company information. We divided the work to clean and prepare the data for analysis through Python. We utilized Tableau to create visualization and I used Google Analytics to prepare our final datafolio for presentation.
