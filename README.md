# studentprojects
These projects are a few examples of the individual and group work that I did while studying business administration and computer information systems in college.
They reflect my analytical thinking, business analysis, and ability to collaborate and publically present before an audience.


# 1. Project: "UNICIRCLE" for course CIS 5800:  Information Technology and Project Management
Description: UniCircle is a concept app to help college students form study groups and professional connections within their own college.
My role: Co-Project Manager and Business Analyst
I computed project costs, time estimates, and developed the marketing strategy and risk/contingency plans.


# 2. Project: “Rose & Renewed: The Book” Website for course CIS 3630: Principles of Web Design
Purpose:  Demonstrate the fundamentals of web design and development by building a functional site.
Description: “Rose & Renewed: The Book” is a concept website and blog promoting a fictional book. The goal is to attract users to buy merchandise.
My role: I wrote the concept and analysis including the website goals, intended users, website visit scenarios, competitor analysis and the web project design. I planned and designed a logo and a product landing page using Canva, layouts and frameworks, then applied web design principles and coding strategies to create a mobile-responsive website with hyperlinks, tables, images, and forms using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. For this site, extra emphasis was focused on the color specifications, graphics, and typography.
