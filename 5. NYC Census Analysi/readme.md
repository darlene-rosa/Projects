## 5. Project: *"Evaluating the NYC Housing Market using 2010-2020 Census Data"* for course CIS 3120:  Programming for Analytics            

**Purpose**:  Demonstrate proficiency using Python to complete a term project.

**Description**:  My team and I analyzed the variances in population and demographics within the 5 boroughs of New York City over the span of a decade using data from the census bureau.

**My role**: Data Analyst, Co-Project Manager, Researcher.

I web scraped data from an Excel file with 3,000+ rows and used Python to clean and prepare the data. With NumPy, I created ndarrays, indexed, and sorted data. Used Pandas to create Series, DataFrames, and aggregated data with GroupBy and pivot tables. I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various visuals for data analysis and to test our hypothesis.
