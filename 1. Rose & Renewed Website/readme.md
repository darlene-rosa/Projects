## 1. Project: *“Rose & Renewed: The Book, The Brand, The Artist”* Website for course CIS 3630:  Principles of Web Design

**Purpose**:  Demonstrate the fundamentals of web design and development by building a functional site.

**Description**: “Rose & Renewed: The Book,  The Brand, The Artist” is a concept website promoting a fictional author, book, and blog. The goal of the website is to promote a book and present a visual aesthetic that will increase audience engagement.

**My role**:  Business Analyst, User Experience, Presentation Designer, Graphic Designer, Web Developer. 
I wrote the concept and analysis (the website goals, intended users, website visit scenarios, competitor analysis and the web project design).
I designed a logo on Canva and sourced images from my personal files in addition to Canva. I placed specific emphasis on the colors used, graphics, and typography to match the aesthetic theme of the project. Using web design principles, coding strategies, layouts and frameworks, I developed the product landing page and mobile-responsive website with hyperlinks, menu, grid, tables, images, and forms using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery.
