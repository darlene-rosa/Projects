## 3.  Project: *"Storytelling with Data - The Olympic Games"* for course CIS 4170:  Data Visualization                       

**Purpose**:  Transform data into visual representations so that decision makers can effectively use interactive visualization for analytical reasoning. Find a dataset and build visuals to tell a story using Tableau. 

**Description**:  With a team of 4 other students, we focused on creating data visualizations on various subtopics within the Olympic Games. For my subtopics, I focused on country participation, prize money per medal, mens and womens record times, Allyson Felix highlights, and most popular sports in the Winter Olympics. We sourced most of our information from datasets found on kaggle.com and created individual excel files to clean and prepare the data.

**My role**:  Co-Project Manager, Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Tableau Analyst, Presentation Designer.

I recommended the general topic idea and led in group discussions, scheduling meetings, and overall direction of the presentation. To create visualizations, I cleaned data in Excel files then used Tableau to display trends using various line graphs, maps, bar charts, and tables.
