# studentprojects
These final projects are a few examples of the individual and group work that I completed while studying business administration and computer information systems at Baruch College during 2020-2021.
They reflect my interests, creativity, business analysis, and ability to collaborate to publically present before an audience.


# 1. Project: “Rose & Renewed: The Book” Website for course CIS 3630: Principles of Web Design
Purpose:  Demonstrate the fundamentals of web design and development by building a functional site.
Description: “Rose & Renewed: The Book” is a concept website and blog promoting a fictional book. The goal is to attract users to buy merchandise.
My role: I wrote the concept and analysis including the website goals, intended users, website visit scenarios, competitor analysis and the web project design. I planned and designed a logo and a product landing page using Canva, layouts and frameworks, then applied web design principles and coding strategies to create a mobile-responsive website with hyperlinks, tables, images, and forms using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. For this site, extra emphasis was focused on the color specifications, graphics, and typography.

# 2. Project: "UNICIRCLE" for course CIS 5800:  Information Technology and Project Management
Description:  UniCircle is a concept app to help college students form study groups and professional connections within their own college.
My role:  Co-Project Manager and Business Analyst
I computed project costs, time estimates, and developed the marketing strategy and risk/contingency plans.

# 3. Project: "Storytelling with Data - The Olympic Games" for course CIS 4170:  Data Visualization                       
Purpose:  Find a dataset and build visuals to tell a story using Tableau. 
Description:  With a group of 4 other students, we focused on creating data visualizations regarding various subtopics within the Olympic Games such as country participation, specific athlete records, record comparisons and most popular sports. We sourced most of our information from datasets found on kaggle.com
My role:  I suggested the general topic idea and was a co-leader in the group discussions and direction of the presentation. For my visualizations, I cleaned data in Excel files then used Tableau to display trends using line graphs, maps, bar charts, and tables.
