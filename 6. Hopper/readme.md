## 6. Project: *"Hopper: A Look at Usability, Privacy and Security"* for CIS 3770: Uability, Privacy, and Security
**Purpose**: Collect data and apply the concepts, methods, and techniques covered in the course to conduct a thorough evaluation of a privacy or security aspect of an existing mobile application and present the findings in audiovisual format.

**Description: Hopper is a free mobile travel application available on iOS and Android that provides data on the cheapest flights, hotels, cars, homes. You can make reservations through the app. I chose Hopper because I like the interface and I have used it for travel.

**My role**: Business Analyst, Researcher, User Experience Tester, Presentation Designer

I evaluated the app for functionality, user authentication, heuristics, security, and the privacy policy. I recruited a user from my target population of the app and provided a script to conduct an individual usability test through the "think aloud" method. I recorded their thought process and created a summary of my findings.
