## 4.  Project: *"Business Analysis of Anthem"* for course BPL 5100:  Business Policy

**Purpose**: Identify and diagnose issues related to interactions among multiple areas of organizations for the company; apply strategic management techniques to generate recommendations for strategic issues; synthesize arguments and recommendations in persuasive oral and written communications.

**Description**:  With a team of 4 other students, for the final term project, our goal was to play the role of external consultants to the company and highlight any current or future problems that the company could face, then provide a recommendation the company could pursue to address this problem, along with actions towards its implementation.

**My role**: Researcher, Project Manager, Business Analyst, Presentation Designer, Copywriter, Editor.

My responsibilities as the Project Manager and Business Analyst were to: maintain the project plan and track progress, document our activities, act as a liaison between the professor and students, and close communication gaps with my team of international students. Throughout the entire term project, I edited the copywriting for company analytical reports for grammatical accuracy and fluency.
